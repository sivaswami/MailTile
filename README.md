# SMART MAIL TILE ANALYTICS

Please reach me for the code/enhancements if you are interested. I am also good to work with you in enhancing this idea to greater level.

## Positioning Statement
Mail analytics app which optimizes mail handling practices with Focus areas : Customer, Suppliers and Operations 
by applying Machine learning, NLP technologies on emails

## Pain Point
Mail Communication is a critical channel in enterprise. The pain is getting inbox piled up with hundreds to thousand of mails in  a single work day. A typical developer receives 100 mails where as an enterprise executive receive thousands of emails where he misses his focus areas.

## Focus Areas
Any Project/Team delivers a Product or Service to Consumer(Internal/External) and gets inputs from Suppliers(Internal/External).
The internal operations also take priority. To effectively manage all 3 areas using mail and other communication tools, We analyze these emails and classify them based on actions, internal, external team and give effective recommendations.

Customers : This could be external customer or internal teams which consume our product
Suppliers : Internal team / External supplier who provide information / data to our product
Operations: Internal Team / Organization
Actions: The next step TODO in the focus areas like FYI, ImmediateAction, DelayAction, PendingAction, Outdated (old infra emails), Useless, SPAM

* Team / Component based Summary â€“ Much organized email tracking in Enterprise level 
* Track your Operations with Customer separately
* Track your Operations with Suppliers separately

## Sample Smart Tile for Customer vs Component(Operations)
Similar tiles will be generated for Supplier vs Operations,  Action vs Supplier, Action vs Customers, Action vs Operations
etc.
